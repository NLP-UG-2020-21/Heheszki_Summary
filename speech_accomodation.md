# 19. Social Variation in Language

## Speech Accommodation

 A variation in speech style is not only based on speakers’ social class and attention to speech, but is also influenced by their perception of their listeners. It is called “audience design,” but is more generally known as speech accommodation, defined as our ability to change our speech style depending on the person we are talking to. 

### Convergence

Convergence is a style by which a speaker attempts to reduce the distance and use forms that are similar to those used by the audience. Yule evokes two examples of a query to see some holiday photographs. First example represents a question to a friend: *"C’mon Tony, gizzalook, gizzalook."*. The second one illustrates a question asked to a friend’s mother: *“Excuse me. Could I have a look at your photos too, Mrs. Hall?“*

### Divergence 

Divergence is a phenomenon when a speech style is supposed to emphasize social distance between speakers. It is usually done by using forms that are distinctly different. Yule evokes an example in which the Scottish teenager shifts to a speech style with features that differ substantially :
T E E N A G E R : *I can’t do it, sir.* 
T E A C H E R : *Oh, come on. If I can do it, you can too* 
T E E N A G E R : *Look, I cannae dae it so … *
The sudden divergence in style seems to be triggered not only by a need to add emphasis to his repeated statement, but also to emphasize that they don’t have the same capacities.
