# Speech style and style-shifting

In his department store study, Labov included another subtle element that
allowed him to investigate not only the type of social stratification illustrated
in table 19.1, but also speech style as a social feature of language use. The
most basic distinction in speech style is between formal uses and informal uses.
Formal style is when we pay more careful attention to how we’re speaking and
informal style is when we pay less attention. They are sometimes described as
‘careful style’ and ‘casual style’. A change from one to the other by an individual
is called style-shifting.
When Labov initially asked the salespeople where certain items were, he
assumed they were answering in an informal manner. After they answered his
question, Labov then pretended not to have heard and said, “Excuse me?” in
order to elicit a repetition of the same expression, which was pronounced with
more attention to being clear. This was taken as a representative sample of the
speaker’s more careful style. When speakers repeated the phrase fourth floor,
the frequency of postvocalic /r/ increased in all groups. The most significant
increase in frequency was among the Macy’s group. In a finding that has been
confirmed in other studies, middle-class speakers are much more likely to shift
their style of speaking significantly in the direction of the upper middle class
when they are using a careful style.
It is possible to use more elaborate elicitation procedures to create more
gradation in the category of style. Asking someone to read a short text out
loud will result in more attention to speech than simply asking them to answer
some questions in an interview. Asking that same individual to read out loud
a list of individual words taken from the text will result in even more careful
pronunciation of those words and hence a more formal version of the individual’s
speech style. When Labov analyzed the way New Yorkers performed in these
elicitation procedures, he found a general overall increase in postvocalic /r/ in
all groups as the task required more attention to speech. Among the lowermiddle-class speakers, the increase was so great in the pronunciation of the
word lists that their frequency of postvocalic /r/ was actually higher than among
upper-middle-class speakers.
As other studies have discovered, when speakers in a middle-status group
try to use a prestige form associated with a higher-status group in a formal
situation, they have a tendency to overuse the form. This has been explained in
terms of the effects of social ambition among the middle class to be ‘better’.
Sensing that a certain pronunciation feature has higher status, these speakers
treat ‘more’ as ‘better’ in their formal speech style.
