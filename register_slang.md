# Register

A register is a conventional way of using language that is appropriate in a specific context and it has an impact on a speech style.  We distinguish situational, occupational or topical register. We can also recognize specific features that occur in the religious register, the legal register and the linguistics register. 

## Jargon 

Jargon can be defined as a defining feature of a register which is special technical vocabulary, typically nouns, associated with a specific area of work or interest. It helps to create and maintain connections among particular communities and environments. Knowledge of a jargon may qualify an individual as a valid professional within that area of expertise. This exclusive effect of specialized jargon, as in the medical register, often leads to misunderstandings.

# Slang 

Slang is typically used among those who do not belong to the established higher-status groups. Slang, or “colloquial speech,” describes words or phrases that are used instead of more everyday terms among younger speakers and other groups with special interests. Like clothing and music, slang is an aspect of social life that is subject to fashion, especially among adolescents and it can become obsolete rather quickly. It can be used to distinguish from others. The difference in slang use between groups divided into older and younger speakers provides some of the clearest support for the idea that age is another important factor involved in the study of social variation in language use. Younger speakers are also much more likely to use taboo terms. 

## Taboo Terms

Taboo terms are words and phrases, often involving body parts, bodily functions and sexual acts, that people avoid for reasons related to religion, politeness and prohibited behavior. They are often swear words, typically “bleeped” in public broadcasting (*What the bleep are you doing, you little bleep!*) or “starred” in print *(S\*\*t! F\*\*\* off! You stupid f\*\*\*ing a\*\*hole!)*. In a study of the linguistic differences among adolescents, both males and females with the lower status used taboo words regularly, whereas students among the higher status group males used taboo words only with other males and females didn’t seem to use them at all. This example illustrates social class divisions taking place during adolescence.
