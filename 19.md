Whereas the traditional study of regional dialects tended to concentrate on the
speech of people in rural areas, as noted in Chapter 18, the study of social
dialects has been mainly concerned with speakers in towns and cities. In the
social study of dialect, it is social class that is mainly used to define groups of
speakers as having something in common. The two main groups are generally
identified as “middle class,” those who have more years of education and
perform non-manual work, and “working class,” those who have fewer years of
education and perform manual work of some kind. So, when we refer to
“working-class speech,” we are talking about a social dialect. The terms “upper”
and “lower” are used to subdivide the groups, mainly on an economic basis,
making “upper-middle-class speech” another type of social dialect or sociolect.
As in all dialect studies, only certain features of language use are treated as
relevant in the analysis of social dialects. These features are pronunciations,
words or structures that are regularly used in one form by working-class
speakers and in another form by middle-class speakers. In Edinburgh, Scotland,
for example, the word home is regularly pronounced as [heɪm], as if rhyming
with fame, among lower-working-class speakers, and as [hom], as if rhyming
with foam, among middle-class speakers. It is a small difference in
pronunciation, but it is an indicator of social status. It may also serve as a subtle
indicator of social identity, used subconsciously by some speakers to mark who
they are, or who they are not. A more familiar example might be the verb ain’t,
as in I ain’t finished yet, which is more often a feature of working-class speech
than middle-class speech.
When we look for other examples of language use that might be
characteristic of a social dialect, we treat class as the social variable and the
pronunciation or word as the linguistic variable. We can then investigate any
systematic variation in usage by counting how often speakers in each class useeach version of the linguistic variable. This is rarely an all-or-nothing situation,
so we usually find that one group uses a certain form more or less than another
and not that only one group or the other uses the form exclusively. (Task F, page
295, has examples of these variables.)
