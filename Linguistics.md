### Education and occupation
People generally tend to assimilate their way of speaking to other with whom they share educational backgrounds and/or occupations. It is pretty easy to distinguish who have left educational system at an early age from those who haven’t, taking into consideration expressions they use. As adults, the outcome of the time spent in the education system is usually reflected in our occupation and socio-economic status. There is a difference between bank executives and window cleaners and it provides linguistics evidence for the significance of these social variables. To exemplify, Labov (1966) compared pronunciation differences among salespeople in three New York City department stores. The author asked them specific questions that contained two opportunities for the pronunciation (or not) of postvocalic /r/ - the /r/ sound after a vowel. It turned out that the higher the socio-economic status of the store, the more /r/ sounds were produced, and the lower the status, the fewer /r/ sounds were produced. However, in a British study provided by Trudgill (1974), it was found that the social value associated with same variable (r) was quite different. Middle-class speakers in Reading pronounced fewer /r/ sounds than working-class speakers. 

### Prestige

In discussing style-shifting, we introduced the idea of a ‘prestige’ form as
a way of explaining the direction in which certain individuals change their
speech. When that change is in the direction of a form that is more frequent
in the speech of those perceived to have higher social status, we are dealing
with overt prestige, or status that is generally recognized as ‘better’ or more
positively valued in the larger community.
There is, however, another phenomenon called covert prestige. This ‘hidden’
status of a speech style as having positive value may explain why certain groups
do not exhibit style-shifting to the same extent as other groups. For example, we
might ask why many lower-working-class speakers do not change their speech
style from casual to careful as radically as lower-middle-class speakers. The
answer may be that they value the features that mark them as members of their
social group and consequently avoid changing them in the direction of features
associated with another social group. They may value group solidarity (i.e sounding like those around them) more than upward mobility (i.e. sounding
like those above them).
Among younger speakers in the middle class, there is often covert prestige
attached to many features of pronunciation and grammar (I ain’t doin’ nuttin’
rather than I’m not doing anything) that are more often associated with the
speech of lower-status groups.

### Register and jargon

Another influence on speech style that is tied to social identity derives from
register. A register is a conventional way of using language that is appropriate in a specific context, which may be identified as situational (e.g. in church),
occupational (e.g. among lawyers) or topical (e.g. talking about language). We
can recognize specific features that occur in the religious register (Ye shall be
blessed by Him in times of tribulation), the legal register (The plaintiff is ready
to take the witness stand) and even the linguistics register (In the morphology
of this dialect there are fewer inflectional suffixes).
One of the defining features of a register is the use of jargon, which is
special technical vocabulary (e.g. plaintiff, suffix) associated with a specific
area of work or interest. In social terms, jargon helps to create and maintain
connections among those who see themselves as ‘insiders’ in some way and
to exclude ‘outsiders’. This exclusive effect of specialized jargon, as in the
medical register (e.g. Zanoxyn is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for
arthritis, bursitis and tendonitis), often leads to complaints about what may
seem like ‘jargonitis’.
