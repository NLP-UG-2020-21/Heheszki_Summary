### Education and occupation
People generally tend to assimilate their way of speaking to other with whom they share educational backgrounds and/or occupations. It is pretty easy to distinguish who have left educational system at an early age from those who havenâ€™t, taking into consideration expressions they use. As adults, the outcome of the time spent in the education system is usually reflected in our occupation and socio-economic status. There is a difference between bank executives and window cleaners and it provides linguistics evidence for the significance of these social variables. To exemplify, Labov (1966) compared pronunciation differences among salespeople in three New York City department stores. The author asked them specific questions that contained two opportunities for the pronunciation (or not) of postvocalic /r/ - the /r/ sound after a vowel. It turned out that the higher the socio-economic status of the store, the more /r/ sounds were produced, and the lower the status, the fewer /r/ sounds were produced. However, in a British study provided by Trudgill (1974), it was found that the social value associated with same variable (r) was quite different. Middle-class speakers in Reading pronounced fewer /r/ sounds than working-class speakers.
