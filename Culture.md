# 20. Language and culture
It is not unusual to find aspects of language identified as characteristic features of African American culture or Eskimo culture or Japanese culture. This approach to the study of language originates in the work of anthropologists who have used language as a source of information in the general study of ‘culture’.

## Culture
We use the term culture to refer to all the ideas and assumptions about the nature of things and people that we learn when we become members of social groups. The particular language we learn through the process of cultural transmission provides us, at least initially, with a readymade
system of categorizing the world around us and our experience of it.


With the words we acquire, we learn to recognize the types of category distinctions that are relevant in our social world. In native cultures of the Pacific, there were no horses and,
not surprisingly, there were no words for them. In order to use words such as *dog* or *horse*, *rain* or *snow*, *father* or *uncle*, *week* or *weekend*, we must have a conceptual system that includes these people, things and ideas as distinct and identifiable categories.

## Categories
Although there is a lot of variation among all the individual ‘dogs’ in our experience, we can use the word *dog* to talk about any one of them as a member of the category. A **category** is a group with certain features in common and
we can think of the vocabulary we learn as an inherited set of category labels. These are the words for referring to concepts that people in our social world have typically needed to talk about.

Some languages may have lots of different words for types of ‘rain’ or kinds of ‘coconut’ and other languages may have only one or two. Although the Dani of New Guinea can see all colors of the spectrum, they only use names for two of them, equivalents of ‘black’ and ‘white’. Eskimos have names for those two, plus red, green and yellow. English has names for
those five colors, plus blue, brown, purple, pink, orange and gray. It seems that languages used by groups with more technology have more color terms.

In some languages, the equivalent of the word *father* is used not only for ‘male parent’, but also for ‘male parent’s brother’. In English,we use the word *uncle* for this other type of individual.

To take a more complex example, when we learn a word such as week or *weekend*, we are inheriting a conceptual system that operates with amounts of time as common categories. Havingwords for units of time such as ‘two days’ or ‘seven days’ shows that we can think of time in amounts, using noun phrases, in the same way as ‘two people’ or ‘seven books’ (i.e. physical objects).

## Linguistic relativity
In the last two examples,we have treated differences in language use as evidence of differentways of talking about external reality. This is often discussed in terms
of linguistic relativity because it seems that the structure of our language, with its predetermined categories, must have an influence on how we perceive the world. In its weak version, this idea simply captures the fact thatwe not only talk, but to a certain extent probably also think about the world of experience, using the categories provided by our language. In its strong version, called linguistic determinism, the idea is restated as “language determines thought”, meaning that we can only think in the categories provided by our language.

A frequently quoted example used to support this view is based on the large number of expressions the Eskimos are reported to have for talking about what, in English, is described as snow. When we, as English speakers, look at wintry scenes, we may only see a single white entity, which we categorize as snow each time.
