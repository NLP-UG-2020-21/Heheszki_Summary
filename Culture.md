# 20. Language and culture
It is not unusual to find aspects of language identified as characteristic features of African American culture or Eskimo culture or Japanese culture. This approach to the study of language originates in the work of anthropologists who have used language as a source of information in the general study of ‘culture’.

## Culture
We use the term culture to refer to all the ideas and assumptions about the nature of things and people that we learn when we become members of social groups. The particular language we learn through the process of cultural transmission provides us, at least initially, with a readymade
system of categorizing the world around us and our experience of it.


With the words we acquire, we learn to recognize the types of category distinctions that are relevant in our social world. In native cultures of the Pacific, there were no horses and,
not surprisingly, there were no words for them. In order to use words such as *dog* or *horse*, *rain* or *snow*, *father* or *uncle*, *week* or *weekend*, we must have a conceptual system that includes these people, things and ideas as distinct and identifiable categories.

## Categories
Although there is a lot of variation among all the individual ‘dogs’ in our experience, we can use the word *dog* to talk about any one of them as a member of the category. A **category** is a group with certain features in common and
we can think of the vocabulary we learn as an inherited set of category labels. These are the words for referring to concepts that people in our social world have typically needed to talk about.

Some languages may have lots of different words for types of ‘rain’ or kinds of ‘coconut’ and other languages may have only one or two. Although the Dani of New Guinea can see all colors of the spectrum, they only use names for two of them, equivalents of ‘black’ and ‘white’. Eskimos have names for those two, plus red, green and yellow. English has names for
those five colors, plus blue, brown, purple, pink, orange and gray. It seems that languages used by groups with more technology have more color terms.
