# 20. Language and culture
Aspects of language are identified as characteristic features of culture. This approach to the study of language originates in the work of anthropologists who have used language as a source of information in the general study of ‘culture’.

## Culture
We use the term culture to refer to all the ideas and assumptions about the nature of things and people that we learn when we become members of social groups. With the words we acquire, we learn to recognize the types of category distinctions that are relevant in our social world. In native cultures of the Pacific, there were no horses and there were no words for them. In order to use words such as *dog* or *horse*, *rain* or *snow*, *father* or *uncle*, *week* or *weekend*, we must have a conceptual system that includes these people, things and ideas as distinct and identifiable categories.

## Categories
Although there is a lot of variation among all the individual ‘dogs’ in our experience, we can use the word *dog* to talk about any one of them as a member of the category. A **category** is a group with certain features in common and we can think of the vocabulary we learn as an inherited set of category labels. These are the words for referring to concepts that people in our social world have typically needed to talk about.

Some languages may have lots of different words for types of ‘rain’ or kinds of ‘coconut’ and other languages may have only one or two. 
* The Dani of New Guinea can see all colors of the spectrum, they only use names for two of them, equivalents of ‘black’ and ‘white’. 
* Eskimos have names for those two, plus red, green and yellow. 
* English has names for those five colors, plus blue, brown, purple, pink, orange and gray. It seems that languages used by groups with more technology have more color terms.

## Linguistic relativity
We treat differences in language use as evidence of different ways of talking about external reality. This is often discussed in terms
of linguistic relativity because it seems that the structure of our language, with its predetermined categories, must have an influence on how we perceive the world. In its weak version, this idea simply captures the fact thatwe not only talk, but to a certain extent probably also think about the world of experience, using the categories provided by our language. In its strong version, called linguistic determinism, the idea is restated as “language determines thought”, meaning that we can only think in the categories provided by our language.

A frequently quoted example used to support this view is based on the large number of expressions the Eskimos are reported to have for talking about what, in English, is described as snow. When we, as English speakers, look at wintry scenes, we may only see a single white entity, which we categorize as snow each time.

## The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis
The general analytic perspective we are considering is part of what became
known as the **Sapir–Whorf hypothesis** during the middle of the twentieth
century. At a time Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf produced arguments that the languages of native Americans, such as the
Hopi, led them to view the world differently from those who spoke European
languages. According to Whorf, the Hopi perceive the world differently from
other tribes because their language leads
them to do so.

In the grammar of Hopi, there is a distinction between ‘animate’
and ‘inanimate’, and among the set of entities categorized as ‘animate’ are
clouds and stones. In Whorf’s words:

>“We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages” (see
Carroll, 1956).

There have been a number of arguments presented against this point of view.
For example, ‘feminine’ markings are also used with the words for
stone and door. Are we forced to conclude that this tribe believes that stones and
doors are female entities in the same way as girls and women? 
The linguistic forms do not force us to ignore biological
distinctions. While the Hopi language has a particular linguistic classification
for the word *stone*, it does not mean that Hopi truck drivers worry about killing
living creatures if they run over stones while driving.

## Eskimos and snow
Reconsidering the situation with Eskimos and ‘snow’. English
does not have a large number of words for different kinds of snow. However,
English speakers can create expressions, by manipulating their language. English speakers can express category variation
by making lexicalized distinctions
and non-lexicalized distinctions, but most of them have a very different view of ‘snow’
from the average Eskimo speaker.

According to Martin (1986), the Eskimos of West Greenland have only two
basicwords for ‘snow’.
From these two basic elements, they are able to create a large number of common
expressions for different snow-related phenomena

Just as Eskimos, in their traditional way of life, developed a set of common
expressions to talk about ‘snow’, so the speakers of Tuvaluan developed many words for different types of ‘coconut’. Our languages reflect our concerns.

We inherit a language used to report knowledge, so we would expect that language
to influence the organization of our knowledge in some way. However, we
also inherit the ability to manipulate and be creative with that language in order
to express our perceptions. 

## Cognitive categories
The fact that Hopi speakers inherit a language
system in which clouds have ‘animate’ as a feature may tell us something about
a traditional belief system, or way of thinking, that is part of their culture and not
ours.

## Classifiers
We know about the classification of words in languages because of
grammatical markers called classifiers that indicate the type or ‘class’ of noun
involved. For example, in Swahili, different prefixes are
used as classifiers on nouns for humans, non-humans and artifacts.
Classifiers are often used in connection with numbers to indicate the type
of thing being counted. 
The closest English comes to using classifiers is when we talk about a ‘unit of’
certain types of things. There is a distinction in English between things treated
as countable and those treated as non-countable. 

## Social categories
Words such as uncle or grandmother, discussed earlier, provide examples of
social categories. These are categories of social organization that we can use
to say how we are connected or related to others. We can use these words as a means of social categorization, that is,
marking individuals as members of a group defined by social connections.

## Address terms
An interaction based on an unequal relationship will feature
address terms using a title or title plus last name
for the one with higher status, and first name only for the one with lower
status.

In many languages, there is a choice between pronouns used for addressees
who are socially close and those who are distant. The higher
status or more powerful speaker could use tu or thou to a lower-status addressee,
but not vice versa.

In English, people without special titles are addressed as *Mr.*, *Mrs.*, *Miss*,
or *Ms.* Only the women’s address terms include information about their social
status. In fact, one of the most frequently used address terms for a woman
indicates that she is the wife of a particular man. When the
original system was put in place, women were obviously identified socially
through their relationship to a man, either as wife or daughter.
This type of observation leads us to a consideration of the most fundamental
difference in social categorization, the one based on ‘gender’.

## Gender
Although the biological distinction, there is a great deal about the social roles of individuals
as men or women that is unrelated to biology. It is in the sense of social
gender, through the process of learning how to become a ‘boy’ or a ‘girl’, that
we inherit a gendered culture. Becoming a social gender also involves
becoming familiar with gendered language use.

## Gendered words
There can be differences between the
words used by men and women in a variety of languages. There are other
examples, used to talk about men and women, which seem to imply that the
words for men are ‘normal’ and the words for women are ‘special additions’.
Within each social class, there is substantial variation according
to gender. Generally speaking, whenever there is a higher versus lower-prestige
variable, women are more likely to
use the higher-prestige forms. The difference is most noticeable among middleclass
speakers.

Forms which are non-standard or associated with working-class speech may be
preferred by men because of their association with manual work, strength and
toughness. And tough guys also have deep voices.

## Gendered speech
In general, men have longer vocal tracts, larger larynxes and thicker vocal cords
than women. The result is that men typically speak in a lower pitch range (80–
200 Herz) than women (120–400 Herz). The term pitch is used to describe
the effect of vibration in the vocal cords, with slower vibration making voices
sound lower and rapid vibration making voices sound higher. 

It is important to pay attention to the concept of ‘same-gender’ talk in describing
features in the speech of men and women because much of our socialization
takes place in such groups. In many societies, this same-gender socialization is reinforced through
separate educational experiences. There are differences in the way each gender approaches interaction with the
other.

## Gendered interaction
One effect of the different styles developed by men and women is that certain
features become very salient in cross-gender interactions. In cross-gender interactions, men are much more
likely to interrupt women. In same-gender conversations, women produce more back-channels as indicators
of listening and paying attention. In cross-gender
interaction, the absence of back-channels from men tends to make women think
the men are not paying attention to them. The more frequent production of
back-channels by women leads men to think that the women are agreeing with
what they’re saying.
Other features have been identified as distinctive aspects of men’s or women’s
ways of using language in interaction. If we are to avoid miscommunication
in this process, we must all be prepared to try to understand the
impact of the cultures we inherit and, through the creativity with language that
we are also given, to find new ways of articulating those cultures before we pass
them on.
