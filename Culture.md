# 20. Language and culture
It is not unusual to find aspects of language identified as characteristic features of African American culture or Eskimo culture or Japanese culture. This approach to the study of language originates in the work of anthropologists who have used language as a source of information in the general study of ‘culture’.

## Culture
We use the term culture to refer to all the ideas and assumptions about the nature of things and people that we learn when we become members of social groups. The particular language we learn through the process of cultural transmission provides us, at least initially, with a readymade
system of categorizing the world around us and our experience of it.


With the words we acquire, we learn to recognize the types of category distinctions that are relevant in our social world. In native cultures of the Pacific, there were no horses and,
not surprisingly, there were no words for them. In order to use words such as *dog* or *horse*, *rain* or *snow*, *father* or *uncle*, *week* or *weekend*, we must have a conceptual system that includes these people, things and ideas as distinct and identifiable categories.
